# Privacy Policy (Template)

Lovely Eye is self-hosted analytics. The site owner is the data controller. This template describes default behavior and can be adapted for your deployment.

## Data We Collect

- Page path (query parameters excluded by default)
- Referrer URL
- UTM source, medium, and campaign
- Device, browser, OS, screen size
- Session timing (entry/exit page, duration, bounce)
- Country (only if enabled)
- Custom events and allowlisted metadata fields

## Visitor Identifiers

We derive a daily-rotating visitor identifier from IP address and user agent. It changes every 24 hours and is not a persistent identifier.

## IP Addresses Under GDPR

IP addresses can be personal data. GDPR does not ban storing them, but it requires a lawful basis, minimized retention, security, and justification.
Lovely Eye uses IPs transiently for hashing and country lookup and does not store them by default.

## Data Retention

Retention is controlled by the site owner. Lovely Eye does not delete analytics data automatically.

## Cookies and Local Storage

Lovely Eye does not use cookies or local storage for analytics tracking by default.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, contact the site owner.
